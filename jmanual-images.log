Package: fancyheadings 2017/06/30 v3.9a Legacy package to call fancyhdr

Package fancyheadings Warning: Please stop using fancyheadings!
(fancyheadings)                Use fancyhdr instead.
(fancyheadings)                We will call fancyhdr with the very same
(fancyheadings)                options you passed to fancyheadings.
(fancyheadings)                
(fancyheadings)                fancyhdr is 99 percent compatible with
(fancyheadings)                fancyheadings. The only incompatibility is
(fancyheadings)                that \headrulewidth and \footrulewidth and
(fancyheadings)                their \plain... versions are no longer length
(fancyheadings)                parameters, but normal macros (to be changed
(fancyheadings)                with \renewcommand rather than \setlength)..
